With shiki-twoslash you can have type-driven hover information accurate errors and type callouts for TypeScript / JavaScript code samples. This blog looks at adding shiki twoslash to a Docusaurus blog.

## What is shiki-twoslash?

Apart from anything else, [shiki-twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) is an open source project by the tremendous [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta) with some of the most beautiful documentation (which I totally ripped off for my title image ðŸ˜‰):

![screenshot of the medieval themed shiki-twoslash documentation reading: THE DOCUMENTATION CONCERNING THE NPM MODULES OF SHIKI-TWOSLASH IN WHICH MARKDOWN CODE SAMPLES ARE POWERED BY THE SYNTAX ENGINE OF VISUAL STUDIO CODE MIXED WITH THE TYPESCRIPT COMPILERâ€™S INFORMATION BY ORTA THEROX PURVEYOR OF RENOWNED OPEN SOURCE CODE](../static/blog/2021-10-07-shiki-twoslash-docusaurus-and-me/screenshot-shiki-twoslash-docs.png)

It's worth drawing out that shiki-twoslash is actually two things combined:

- [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) is VS Code's syntax highlighter packaged for running in a web browser and statically via Node.js.
- Twoslash can pile on top of that and enrich TypeScript / JavaScript code blocks using the same compiler APIs as VS Code to provide type-driven hover information, accurate errors and type callouts.

So bringing these things together we can have beautiful code samples, which in the case of TS / JS are super powered! 

## shiki-twoslash meet Docusaurus

The hard work of integrating shiki-twoslash and Docusaurus has been handled by a marvellous npm package named [`docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash). We're going to use it to migrate my blog to using shiki-twoslash.

First up, we'll add that package to our dependencies:

```
yarn add docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash
```

Next we're going to reference that package in our `docusaurus.config.js`, in the `presets` section: 

```js twoslash
/** @type {import('@docusaurus/types').DocusaurusConfig} */
module.exports = {
  //...
  presets: [
    //...
    [
      "docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash",
      {
        themes: ['min-light', 'nord'],
        defaultCompilerOptions: {
          types: ['node'],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```
