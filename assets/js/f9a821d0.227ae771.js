Union types are being ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/543598#PostDetailsCell_1239340"},"discussed at present")," but in TypeScript v1.0 world the only viable approach is returning the ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"any")," type. This implies ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"val()")," returns any possible JavaScript value from ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"boolean")," to ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Function")," and straight on 'til morning.
