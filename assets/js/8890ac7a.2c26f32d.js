The only information that has gone to the server are the relevant criteria to drive the search results. The only information that has come back from the server is the data needed to drive the grid. Simple. Beautiful. I loved it and I wanted to use it. So I did! I had to take a few steps that most people thinking about using a grid component probably wont need to. First of all I had to write an ASP.Net WebForms wrapper for jqGrid which could be implemented in a similar way to our current custom datagrid. This was because, until the users were convinced that the new grid was better than the old both had to co-exist in the project and the user would have the option to switch between the two. This WebForms wrapper plugged into our old school XML column definition files and translated them into JSON for the grid. It also took ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.dataset.aspx"}),"datasets")," (which drove our old grid) and translated them into jqGrid-friendly JSON. I wanted to power the jqGrid using WebMethods on ASPX's. After a little digging I found ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://encosia.com/using-jquery-to-directly-call-aspnet-ajax-page-methods/"}),"Dave Ward of Encosia's post")," which made it very simple (and in line with this I switched over from ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GET_%28HTTP%29#Request_methods"}),"GET")," requests to ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29"}),"POSTs"),"). Finally I wrote some custom javascript which added a button to jqGrid which, if clicked, would copy the contents of the jqGrid to the clipboard (this was the only bit of functionality that didn't appear to be implemented out of the box with jqGrid). I think I'm going to leave it there for now but I just wanted to say that I think jqGrid is a fantastic component and it's certainly made my life better!

Before very long I discovered one ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://www.elijahmanor.com/"}),"Elijah Manor")," who had helpfully done a number of talks and blog posts directed at C# developers (which I was) about JavaScript.

In my development life so far I had only ever dealt with strongly typed, compiled "classical" languages. I had little to no experience of functional, dynamic and loosely typed languages (essentially what JavaScript is). Elijahs work opened up my eyes to some of the massive differences that exist.

Who could not like a book about JavaScript which starts each chapter with a quote from Shakespeare and still comes in at only a 100 pages? It's also worth watching the man in person as he's a thoroughly engaging presence. There's loads of videos of him out there but this one is pretty good: ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ifWcnQs6M"}),"Douglas Crockford: The JavaScript Programming Language"),". I don't want to waste your time by attempting to rehash what these guys have done already. I think it's always best to go to the source so I'd advise you to check them out for yourselves. That said it's probably worth summarising some of the main points I took away from them (you can find better explanations of all of these through looking at their posts): 1. JavaScript has objects but has no classes. Instead it has (what I still consider to be) the weirdest type of inheritance going: prototypical inheritance. 2. JavaScript has the simplest and loveliest way of creating a new object out there; the \"JavaScript Object Literal\". Using this we can simply ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'var myCar = { wheels: 4, colour: "blue" }')," and ladies and gents we have ourselves a car! (object) 3. In JavaScript functions are ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function"}),"first class objects"),". This means functions can be assigned to variables (as easily as you'd assign a string to a variable) and crucially you can pass them as parameters to a function and pass them back as a return type. Herein lies power! 4. JavaScript has 6 possible values (false, null, undefined, empty strings, 0 and NaN) which it evaluates as false. These are known as the \"false-y\" values. It's a bit weird but on the plus side this can lead to some nicely terse code. 5. To perform comparisons in JavaScript you should avoid == and != and instead use === and !==. Before I discovered this I had been using == and != and then regularly puzzling over some truly odd behaviour. Small though it may sound, this may be the most important discovery of the lot as it was this that lead to me actually ","*",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"trusting"),"*"," the language.

(After all, in any sane universe should this really evaluate to true?: ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'0 == ""'),') 6. Finally JavaScript has function scope rather than block scope.

It is without question the easiest language with which to create a proper dogs breakfast. To get the best out of JavaScript we need to understand the quirks of the language and we need good patterns.

The project was part financial reporting system and part sales incentivisation tool; it was used internally in the investment bank in which I was working. The project had been in existence for a number of years and had a web front end which at that point would been built in a combination of HTML, JavaScript, classic ASP and with a Visual Basic 6.0 back end. One of the reasons I had been brought on to the project was to help \".Net-ify\" the thing and migrate it to ASP.NET and C#. I digress. The interesting thing about this app was that there were actually some quite advanced things being done with it (despite the classic ASP / VB). The users could enter trades into the system which represented actual trades that had been entered into a trading system elsewhere in the organisation. These trades would be assigned a reporting value which would be based on their various attributes. (Stay with me people this will get more interesting I \\*promise\\*.) The calculation of the reporting value was quite an in depth process and needed to be performed server-side. However, the users had decreed that it wasn't acceptable to do a full postback to the server to perform this calculation; they wanted it done \"on-the-fly\".

It's possible, but ugly, not that quick and requires an awful lot of manual serialization / deserialization operations. It's clearly powerful but not much fun at all. And that's where I left it for a number of years. Let's fade to black...

Now I'm always interested in \"the new\" and so I was naturally interested in this.

Initially I just switched over from using webservice.htc to ASP.NET Ajax. This alone gave us a ","*",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"massive"),"*",' performance improvement (I know it was massive since we actually received a "well done" email from our users which is testament to the difference it was making to their experience of the system). But we were still performing our manual serialisation / deserialisation of values on the client and the server. ie. Using Ajax was now much faster but still not too much fun. Let\'s jump forward in time again to around 2010 to the point in time when I was discovering jQuery and that JavaScript wasn\'t actually evil. It\'s not unusual for me to play around with "what if" scenarios in my code, just to see what might might be possible. Sometimes I discover things. So it was with JSON. We had a web service in the system that allowed us to look up a counterparty (ie a bank account) with an identifier.

I will get to that but not this time. This time WCF authentication quirks. I've been working on a project that uses .NET Remoting to have a single central point to which web applications and Windows services can call into. This is used in an intranet environment and all the websites and Windows services were hosted on the same single server along with our .NET Remoting Windows service. (They could quite easily have been on different servers but there was no need in this case.) It was decided to \"embrace the new\" by migrating this .NET Remoting project over to WCF. The plan wasn't to do anything revolutionary, just to move from one approach to the other as easily as possible. I found the following useful article on MSDN: ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730857%28v=vs.80%29.aspx"}),"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730857%28v=vs.80%29.aspx")," This particular article was helpful and following the steps enclosed I was quickly up and running with a basic WCF service hosted in a Windows service. It was at this point I started thinking about security. The existing .NET Remoting approach had no security in place. This wasn't ideal but also probably wasn't the worry you might think. It was hosted in an intranet environment and hence not so exposed to the rigours of the Wild Wild Web. However, since I was looking at WCF I thought it would be a good opportunity to get some basic security in place. This generally pleases auditors. I opted to use ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733089.aspx"}),"Windows Transport authentication")," as this seemed pretty appropriate for an intranet environment.

After headbutting Windows for some time I managed to get a successful client call going from the website running on my development machine to the (separate) development server that was hosting our WCF Window service using Transport Windows authentication.

So we you wanted to, we could have a simple step which evaluated if the calling user is on the "approved" / "authorised" list. I\'m sure this could be made more sophisticated by using groups etc I guess - though I haven\'t investigated it further as yet. In fact, I suspect Microsoft may have something even more sophisticated still available for use which I\'m unaware of - if anyone knows a simple explanation of this then please do let me know! In closing, I do think Microsoft could work on providing more helpful error messages than "the server has rejected the client credentials".

Some years ago I came upon this article by Christan Heilmann about the JavaScript Object Literal which had been published all the way back in 2006: ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://christianheilmann.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/"}),"Show love to the JavaScript Object Literal")," Now when I read this it was a revelation to me. I hadn't really used JavaScript objects a great deal at this point (yes I am one of those people that started using JavaScript without actually learning the thing) and when I had used them is was through the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"var obj = new Object()")," pattern (as that's the only approach I knew). So it was wonderful to discover that instead of the needlessly verbose:"),(0,a.kt)("pre",null,(0,a.kt)("code",o({parentName:"pre"},{className:"language-js"}),"var myCar = new Object();\nmyCar.wheels = 4;\nmyCar.colour = 'blue';\n")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"I could simply use the much more concise object literal syntax to declare an object instead:"),(0,a.kt)("pre",null,(0,a.kt)("code",o({parentName:"pre"},{className:"language-js"}),"var myCar = { wheels: 4, colour: 'blue' };\n")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Lovely. Henceforth I adopted this approach in my code as I'm generally a believer that brevity is best. It was sometime later that I happened upon JSON (when I started looking into ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.com/2012/01/jqgrid-its-just-far-better-grid.html"}),"jqGrid"),"). Basically I was looking to pass complex data structures backward and forward to the server and, as far as I knew, there was no way to achieve this simply in JavaScript.

I've left the post in place below but much of what I said (particularly with regard to Hungarian Notation) I've now moved away from. That was originally my intention anyway so that's no bad thing. The one HN artefact that I've held onto is using \"$\" as a prefix for jQuery objects. I think that still makes sense. I would have written my first line of JavaScript in probably 2000. It probably looked something like this: ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"alert('hello world')"),". I know. Classy. As I've mentioned before it was around 2010 before I took JavaScript in any way seriously. Certainly it was then when I started to actively learn the language. Because up until this point I'd been studiously avoiding writing any JavaScript at all I'd never really given thought to forms and conventions. When I wrote any JavaScript I just used the same style and approaches as I used in my main development language (of C#). By and large I have been following the .net naming conventions which are ably explained by Pete Brown ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards---best-practices"}),"here"),". Over time I have started to move away from this approach. Without a deliberate intention to do so I have found myself adopting a different style for my JavaScript code as compared with anything else I write. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm completely happy with the style I'm currently using. But I find it more helpful than not and thought it might be worth talking about.

All these functions would contain a number of different variables.

Okay there is no \"until\" as such, it did work fine. But what I found was that I would do a piece of work, check it into source control, get users to test it, release the work into Production and promptly move onto the next thing. However, a little way down the line there would be a request to add a new feature or perhaps a bug was reported and I'd find myself back looking at the code. And, as is often the case, despite the comments I would realise that it wasn't particularly clear why something worked in the way it did. (Happily it's not just me that has this experience, paranoia has lead me to ask many a fellow developer and they have confessed to similar) When it came to bug hunting in particular I found myself cursing the lack of friendly tooltips and the like. Each time I wanted to look at a variable I'd find myself tracking back through the function, looking for the initial use of the variable to determine the type. Then I'd be tracking forward through the function for each subsequent use to ensure that it conformed. Distressingly, I would find examples of where it looked like I'd forgotten the type of the variable towards the end of a function (for which I can only, regrettably, blame myself).

For those of you that don't remember HN was pretty much the standard way of coding at one point (although at the point that I started coding professionally it had already started to decline). It was adopted in simpler times long before the modern IDE's that tell you what each variable is became the norm. Back when you couldn't be sure of the types you were dealing with. In short, kind of like my situation with JavaScript right now. There's not much to it. By and large HN simply means having a lowercase prefix of 1-3 characters on all your variables indicating type. It doesn't solve all your problems. It doesn't guarantee to stop bugs. But because each instance of the variables use implicitly indicates it's type it makes bugs more glaringly obvious. This means when writing code I'm less likely to misuse a variable (eg ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'iNum = "JIKJ"'),") because part of my brain would be bellowing: \"that just looks wrong... pay better attention lad!\". Likewise, if I'm scanning through some JavaScript and searching for a bug then this can make it more obvious.

More it is seeking to provide a guide on how a variable should be used. JavaScript does not have integers.

You could control how JS problems were reported; as warnings, errors etc. You could straightforwardly exclude files from evaluation (essential if you\'re reliant on a number of 3rd party JS libraries which you are not responsible for maintaining). You could cater for predefined variables; allow for jQuery or DOJO. You could simply evaluate a single file in your solution by right clicking it and hitting the "JS Lint" option in the context menu.

Along with this there has, in my opinion, also been something of a unifying of purpose in the developer community of late. I attribute this to JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Back when I started out it seemed much more the case that developers were split into different tribes. There was the Delphi tribe, the Visual Basic tribe, the C++ tribe, the Java tribe (very much the \"hip young gunslingers\" tribe back then - I guess these days it'd be the Node.JS guys) as well as many others. And each tribe more or less seemed to keep themselves to themselves. This wasn't malicious that I could tell; that just seemed to be the way it was. But shortly after I started out the idea of the web application took off in a major way. I was involved in this coming from the position of being an early adopter of ASP.NET (which I used, and loved, since it was first in beta). Many other web application technologies were available; JSP, PHP, Perl and the like. But what they all had in common was this: they all pumped out HTML and CSS to the user. Suddenly all these developers from subtly different backgrounds were all targeting the same technology for their GUI. This unifying effect has been ","*",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"massively"),"*"," reinforced by JavaScript. Whereas HTML is a markup language, JavaScript is a programming language.

Given the rise and rise of the rich web client (driven onwards and upwards by the popularity of AJAX, Backbone.JS etc) this has meant that devs of all creeds and colours have been forced to pitch a tent on the same patch of dirt. Pretty much all of the tribes now have an embassy in JavaScript land. So there are all these devs out there who are used to working with different server-side technologies from each other. But when it comes to the client, we are all sharing the common language of JavaScript. To a certain extent we're all creating data services that just pump out JSON to the client. Through forums like ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://stackoverflow.com/"}),"StackOverflow")," devs of all the tribes are helping each other with web client \"stuff\".

IE 6 had come out 3 years previously and had vanquished all comers. Microsoft was really the only game in town browser-wise. Things had stopped changing; it seemed like browsers were \"done\". You know, good enough and there was no need to take things any further. Then came Firefox. This lone browser appeared as an alternative to might of IE. I must admit the thing that first attracted me to Firefox was the fact it had tabs. I mean technically I knew Firefox was more secure than IE but honestly it was the tabs that attracted me in the first place. (This may offer some insight as to why so many people still smoke...) And somehow Firefox managed to jolt Microsoft out of it's inertia on the web. Microsoft started caring about IE again. (Not enough until quite recently in my book but you've got to start somewhere.) I'm a firm believer that change for it's own sake can often be a good thing.

Some background. I'm working on an ASP.NET MVC 3 project which provides users with a nice web interface to manage the workflow surrounding certain types of financial asset. The user is presented with a web page which shows a kind of grid to the user. As the user hovers over a row they are presented with a context menu which allows them to perform certain workflow actions. If they perform an action then that row will need to be updated to reflect this. Back in the day this would have been achieved by doing a full postback to the server. At the server the action would be taken, the persistent storage updated and then the whole page would be served up to the user again with the relevant row of HTML updated but everything else staying as is. Now there's nothing wrong with this approach as such. I mean it works just fine. But in my case since I knew that it was only that single row of HTML that was going to be updated and so I was loath to re-render the whole page. It seemed a waste to get so much data back from the server when only a marginal amount was due to change. And also I didn't want the user to experience the screen refresh flash. Looks ugly. Now in the past when I've had a solution to this problem which from a UI perspective is good but from a development perspective slightly unsatisfactory. I would have my page call a controller method (via ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"jQuery.ajax"),") to perform the action. This controller would return a ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"JsonResult")," indicating success or failure and any data necessary to update the screen. Then in the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"success")," function I would manually update the HTML on the screen using the data provided. Now this solution works but there's a problem. ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Harris"}),"Can you tell what it is yet?")," It's not very DRY. I'm repeating myself. When the page is initially rendered I have a ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"View")," which renders (in this example) all the relevant HTML for the screen ","*","including","*"," the HTML for my rows of data. And likewise I have my JavaScript method for updating the screen too. So with this solution I have duplicated my GUI logic. If I update 1, I need to update the other. It's not a massive hardship but it is, as I say, unsatisfactory. I was recently thinking that it would be nice if I could refactor my row HTML into a ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Partial View")," which I could then use in 2 places: 1. In my standard ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"View")," as I iterated through each element for display and 2. Nested inside a ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"JsonResult"),"..."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The wonderful thing about approach 2 is that it allows me to massively simplify my ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"success")," to this:"),(0,a.kt)("pre",null,(0,a.kt)("code",o({parentName:"pre"},{className:"language-js"}),"$('myRowSelector').empty().html(data.RowHTML); //Where RowHTML is the property that\n//contains my stringified PartialView\n")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"and if I later make changes to the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Partial View")," these changes will not require me to make any changes to my JavaScript at all. Brilliant! And entirely satisfactory. On the grounds that someone else might have had the same idea I did a little googling around. Sure enough I discovered ",(0,a.kt)("a",o({parentName:"p"},{href:"http://craftycodeblog.com/2010/05/15/asp-net-mvc-render-partial-view-to-string/"}),"Kevin Craft's post")," which was just the ticket. It does exactly what I'd hoped. Besides being a nice and DRY solution this approach has a number of other advantages as well: - Given it's a ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Partial View")," the Visual Studio IDE provides a nice experience when coding it up with regards to intellisense / highlighting etc. Not something available when you're hand coding up a string which contains the HTML you'd like passed back..."),(0,a.kt)("ul",null,(0,a.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"A wonderful debug experience.
