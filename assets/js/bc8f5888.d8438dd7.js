I\'d been vaguely aware of the phrase "jQuery" being increasingly mentioned on various techical websites since about 2009. But for some reason I\'d felt no urge to find out what it was. I seem to remember that I read the name "jQuery" and jumped to the perfectly logical (in my head) conclusion that this must be a Java SQL engine of some sort. (After all "j" as a prefix to anything so far had generally been Java and "Query" just rang of databases to me.)

This lead to me reaching the (incorrect) conclusion that jQuery was basically an alternative to the ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_AJAX#Microsoft_Ajax_Library"},"Microsoft Ajax library")," which we were already using to call various Web Services.

Well, the app that I was working on was an internal web application only used by people with the corporate installation of IE 6 on their desktops. And it was "terribly important" that buttons had hover behaviour. For reasons that now escape me we were doing this by manually adding inline onmouseover / onmouseout event handlers to each input button on the screen in turn in every page in the ',(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx"},"Page_Load")," event server side.
